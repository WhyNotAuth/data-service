# data-service
Service for interacting with data centric user stores (non-federated).

## Supported Databases

To start we'll just support Mongo, as that'll be what the admin portal uses to store users by default.
I'll be making specific schemas and interfaces for what everything should look like soon. That way you
can just implement an interface and be g2g.
